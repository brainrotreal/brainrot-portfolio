In this system, players can be temporarily <span class="bold">downed</span> instead of immediately <span class="bold">eliminated</span>. When <span class="bold">downed</span>, the player collapses to the ground and becomes <span class="bold">incapacitated</span>, unable to move or fight back. Other players can approach a <span class="bold">downed enemy</span> and perform a <span class="bold">stomp execution</span> to finish them off. The system includes smooth <span class="bold">transitions between states</span> (active → downed → executed), clear <span class="bold">visual feedback</span>, and fluid <span class="bold">character animations</span>. It provides an <span class="bold">immersive</span> and <span class="bold">strategic</span> layer to combat, allowing for both <span class="bold">recoveries</span> and <span class="bold">stylish eliminations</span>.
