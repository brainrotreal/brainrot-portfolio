This system creates a <span class="bold">line of clones</span> that <span class="bold">follow the player</span> in real time. Each <span class="bold">clone</span> accurately mirrors the player's <span class="bold">movement</span> and dynamically matches the player's <span class="bold">walkspeed</span>. The clones maintain a smooth <span class="bold">formation</span> behind the player, adjusting their positions seamlessly as the player moves faster, slower, or changes direction. This setup showcases <span class="bold">synchronized movement</span>, <span class="bold">responsive speed adaptation</span>, and <span class="bold">fluid clone behavior</span> for a highly polished gameplay mechanic.
